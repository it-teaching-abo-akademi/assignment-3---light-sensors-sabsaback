The aim of this lab is to evaluate the precision of a light sensor and  
develop a simple low-level data fusion application across sensors  
(in a competitive configuration with 4 identical sensors). 
  
Additionally, you will need to implement a way to detect faulty sensor(s),  
so that the output of the fusion algorithm will take into account only the data from working sensors.
